# Prompt

You are evaluating responses from a caller who is asked the question: "Please provide your name and number."

Determine if the response contains both a name and a phone number. The phone number can be in any format (e.g., (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890, or 1234567890). If the response contains both, return True. If either the name or the phone number is missing, return False. If both are missing, return False.

Respond with either True or False based on the caller's input. Provide no additional explanation.
